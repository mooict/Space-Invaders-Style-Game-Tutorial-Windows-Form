# C# Space Invaders Style Game Tutorial in Windows Form
In this tutorial we will make a simple and fun space invaders style game called sad invaders. Yea let that sink in for a second. OK we're good now. Basically I just changed a few things around for the game tutorial and change the player character to a high definition triangle and the invaders to a super sophisticated sad face image i made in power point. 

In the initial tutorial, we manually add the invaders to the form, tag them and then use a for each loop to animate and interact with them in the game. This version of the game is made through the code mainly, we are setting up the variables, adding time, key down and key up events. We create few different custom classes that create the invaders for the game, make bullets that shoot from the player and shoot down towards the player also we are spawning the and animating the invaders. 

What we are doing in this project is that we are taking the existing tutorial from MOO ICT website links above and more functionality to it and making it more interactive.
